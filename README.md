### App Structure:
+ Model View Presenter (MVP)
+ Package by feature
+ Kotlin
+ Lightweight class injection
+ JVM tests
+ UI tests using Espresso.

Note: to run the ui tests switch to the build variant **mockDebug** and to run the app reading from the json file use the **mockDebug or mockRelease** build variants
